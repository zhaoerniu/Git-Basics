#### Getting Git installed
* Use `git --version` to find out if Git is installed.
* If it's not, install it using `sudo apt-get install git`.
* After it's installed, confirm everything is working properly with another use of `git --version`.
#### Git Commands
* `git init [project_name]` - initializes a new repository. If `project_name` is provided, it creates a new project directory with that name. If not, it initializes a repository in the current directory.
#### Unix Command Refresher
* `cd` - think 'change directory:' change the current working directory. Remember that `~` is a special symbol that always represents your "home" directory.
* `ls` - think 'list:' shows a list of all files/folders in the current directory. With the `-a` flag, also shows hidden files and folders.
* `mkdir` - think 'make directory:' creates a new directory with the specified name.
* `touch` - updates the "last modified" timestamp on a file to now. Also creates an empty file if the filename specified doesn't exist.
* `mv` - think 'move:' moves a file or directory to a new location. This also makes it a convenient way to rename files and folders.
* `rm` - think 'remove:' deletes the file(s)/folder(s) specified.
