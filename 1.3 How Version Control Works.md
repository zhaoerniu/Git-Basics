* In UNIX-based systems, hidden files and folders are indicated by having their name prefixed with a '.' - so a file named repository isn't hidden, but a file named .repository would be. Windows doesn't respect this convention, so don't be surprised if your "hidden" repository folder is perfectly visible on a Windows machine. Just pretend it isn't there :)
