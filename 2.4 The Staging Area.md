#### Git Commands
* `git status` - show the current status of the git repository, including if there are any uncommitted changes and whether or not any of our changes have been put in the staging area.
* `git add` - not a new command for this video, but we learned that it does something more than just add files to be tracked - it also adds changes to the staging area.
* `git commit` - not a new command for this video, but we learned that without any arguments (or the `-a` flag) it will default to committing everything that's currently in the staging area.
