#### Editing Files
If you're following along in Windows, remember to use 'notepad' every time I use 'nano,' because nano isn't available on your system. If you're following along on your own Mac/Linux machine, nano may not be your default editor. If you want to set nano as your default editor so that Git will use it, run export EDITOR=nano before you try to run any of these commands. If you're curious about what this does, there's an [article explaining it here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Environment_Variables#EDITOR).
#### Git Commands
* `git add` - adds files to the repository so that Git knows to track their changes.
* `git commit` - commits all added files to the repository as a change. With the `-a` flag, commits all changes to all tracked files. With the `-m` flag, allows you to specify a commit message directly on the command line instead of in your default editor.
* `git config` - allows you to make configuration changes to Git. With the `--global` flag, makes these changes available across your entire system.
